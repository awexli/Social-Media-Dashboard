## The challenge

My task was to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## Where to find everything

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. Inside the folder includes both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This meant that I needed to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This helps to train my eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets were already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information such as color palette and fonts.

The `/src` folder inlcudes my `/scss` folder, `script.js`, and `style.css` file. In the `/scss` folder, I tried my best to seperate each `.scss` file into their own components. This allowed for better resuablity and easier code maintanence.

## What I learned

- Structuring HTML/CSS that allowed for better reusablity and code maintenance
- Component-based approach
- Consistent CSS class names
- ::before & ::after CSS selectors
- CSS transitions/transform
- Media queries
- Flex box & Grid
- Sass mixins/variable mapping/ampersands
- That I knew way less than I had thought prior to this challenge

## Utilized

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- JavaScript
